# Lighting-alphabets-board-tutorial
This is a tutorial of our lighting alphabets board. You can control the light through the keyboard. The alphabet is crafted on the glass board. We display it in a more dynamic way. In addition, we combine the arduino technology with our traditional glass craft, make the letters on alphabet board react to the keyboard input and shine.
