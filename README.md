# Lighting-alphabets-board-tutorial

This is a tutorial of our lighting alphabets board. You can control the light through the keyboard. The alphabet is crafted on the glass board. We display it in a more dynamic way. In addition, we combine the arduino technology with our traditional glass craft, make the letters on alphabet board react to the keyboard input and shine.

Here is the process:

1. make the prototype light board with arduino kit
2. set the code part on arduino and processing programme
3. test the prototype
4. connect the lights and arduino kit to the display board and glass board
